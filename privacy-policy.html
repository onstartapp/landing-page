            <h2>II. PROCESSED INFORMATION:</h2>

            <p>There are several categories of information that might be processed: (a) Functional data, (b) Payment Information, (c) Automatically Processed Data, (d) Contact information. Please refer to Section III to learn more details.</p>
            <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>

            <h2 id="part-iii">III. THE PURPOSES OF PROCESSING DATA</h2>

            <p>We use your information for the following purposes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>To provide the App and its services: We use your information to provide the App and its services to you. This includes processing functional information and automatically processed information to ensure that you can access and use the App as intended.</p>
                    <p><strong>(a) Functional data</strong></p>
                    <p>To fulfill our contractual obligations and provide the requested services we require functional data. This is absolutely necessary to guarantee the full functionality of the App.</p>
                    <p>User Content: This includes any text or other content that you enter into the message field and send through the App (“Input”), as well as any text or other content generated by AI via the App (“Output”). You may use, share, and otherwise exploit your User Content for your own purposes, subject to your compliance with the rules and restrictions outlined in our Terms of Use. However, any use of User Content is solely at your own risk, and you assume all risks and responsibilities associated with such use. You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws when using User Content. Please note that we use third-party service providers, OpenAI, L.L.C., Anthropic Ireland, Limited and Anthropic, PBC, for processing and creating AI-generated User Content. We also engage the third-party service provider Phrasly LLC for the purposes of checking whether your text has been written by AI within the in-app feature “AI Detector”. Additionally, if you choose to try the “GPT + Internet” feature, your Input will be processed by our third-party service providers, Microsoft Corporation and Google LLC, in order to obtain Internet search results pertinent to your Input and update your Output accordingly. Please refer to Section IV to learn more about OpenAI, L.L.C.'s, , Anthropic Ireland, Limited’s, Anthropic, PBC’s, Microsoft Corporation’s and Google LLC’s privacy policies and practices.</p>
                    <p>Contact Information: This includes your name, email address, and any other content you provide when contacting us via email or support form. We store and process this information using our cloud storage provider, Amazon.com, Inc. We use this information to respond to your inquiries, fulfill your requests, and provide you with requested services or communications.</p>
                    <p><strong>(b) Payment Information</strong></p>
                    <p>Our e-commerce provider, Apple, is responsible for securely processing and charging for in-app purchases, and for handling your personal information in a safe and secure manner. We do not have access to or use your credit or debit card information as this is processed as part of the contract between you and Apple. You may access the rules and policies for in-app purchases directly from the app stores. You can access the relevant rules and policies for "in-app" purchases directly from the app stores.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>To improve the App and personalize your experience: We use automatically processed information to analyze how users interact with the App, identify areas for improvement, and test new features and functionality. This helps us to continuously improve the App and provide a better service. We may use automatically processed information to personalize your experience within the App. For example, we may use this information to show you content that is tailored to your interests, or to suggest features or services that may be of interest to you.</p>
                    <p><strong>(c) Automatically Processed Data</strong></p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: '-  '">
                        <li>Log file information. When you access the App, log file information is automatically generated and reported. Additionally, this information may be provided when you install the App on your device. Our analytics tools automatically record specific log file information when you use the App, such as the start and stop time and date of usage, and how you interact with the App.</li>
                        <li>Mobile Device Data, including “device identifiers”. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device (but not your personality). Device identifier enables generalized reporting or personalized content and ads by the third parties.Certain device identifiers are processed to improve the quality of customer support. We automatically process information about the device itself (type of device, type of operating system and its version, model and manufacturer, screen size, screen density, orientation, audio volume and battery, battery life, loading time, latency, framerate, device memory usage), information about the Internet connection (mobile carrier, network provider, network type, IP address, timestamp and duration of sessions, speed, browser), location-related information (IP address, the country code/ region/ state/ city associated with your SIM card or your device, language setting, time zone, neighboring commercial points of interest (eg. “coffee shop”)), other device identifiers: e.g. user identifiers (if they are set up by the App’s developer). In case you submit a support request, the device identifiers to be processed additionally comprise your device ID (identification number of your mobile device) and your user ID (the number assigned to the App upon its installation at your device). The processing of user ID and device ID enables us to review your support request in a more detailed manner as applied to your particular case. This therefore may allow us a) to expedite your support request (e.g. complete troubleshooting); and, if needed b) to approach you with a tailor-made solution for fixing the issue being of concern for you.</li>
                        <li>Cookies and similar technologies. When you use the App, cookies and similar technologies may be used (pixels, web beacons, scripts). A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you access the App. The text file is then sent back to the server each time you use the App. This enables us to operate the App more effectively. For example, we will know how many users access specific areas or features within our App and which links or ads they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our App is used, improve our marketing efforts, and provide content and features that are of interest to you. We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to the App, which may use cookies or similar technologies.</li>
                        <li>Information about the applications. Name, API key (identifier for application), version, properties of our App can be reported for automated processing and analysis. Some services also record the list of applications and/or processes which are installed or run on your device.</li>
                        <li>Ad-related information. Information related to advertisements that you view, such as the time and date the ad is shown, whether you clicked on it or if it resulted in a conversion event, the content and type of the ad (such as text, image, or video), where it was displayed in the App, and your response to the ad, may be reported.</li>
                        <li>In-App Events. Analytics tools integrated into our App automatically capture and store data related to your in-App activities, such as completing tutorial steps, making in-app purchases or payments, triggering custom events, progressing through levels or stages, and any opt-out mechanisms used to limit data processing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The data is processed via third-party automatic data processing technologies, such as advertising or analytics tools, to analyze certain information sent by your device through our App (e.g., Identity For Advertisers for iOS devices/ Advertising ID or Android ID for Android devices), with your permission. This data is typically non-personal, meaning it cannot be directly linked to any specific individual, and we only access it in an aggregated form. However, some of these integrated tools (please see <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="goTo('#fourth-sharing')">Section V</a> for a list) may conduct automated processing of your personal data, including profiling. Profiling involves any form of automated processing of personal data used to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to you, particularly to analyze or predict aspects concerning your personal preferences, interests, behavior, location or movements (please refer to the list of data below). Automatic data processing technologies will start processing information as soon as you allow our App to track your activity. You may withdraw your permission at any time by checking the opt-out options in Section VIII below.</p>
                    <p>Please note that we do not have control over the information provided automatically to advertising or analytics tools, and therefore cannot take responsibility for the processing of such information. It is important to be aware that some services engage in personal data profiling and may obtain information related to your personality or device through technologies that are not under our responsibility. If your user ID is linked to your Facebook account, Facebook may use your device information in conjunction with categorized data that have already been recorded in its databases, such as your age, gender, or other demographic indicators. We do not supervise, control, or guarantee how third parties handle your personal data that may be collected through means other than our app. If you have any questions about the disclosure of your personal information, please direct them to the third parties involved (refer to <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="goTo('#fourth-sharing')">Section V</a>).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>To communicate with you: We may use your contact information to communicate with you about the App, such as to provide you with updates, respond to your inquiries, and provide customer support.</p>
                    <p><strong>(d) Contact Information:</strong> your name, your email address and data that you might enter and upload as part of your support request.</p>
                </li>
                <li>To enforce our policies and protect our rights: We may use your information to enforce our policies and protect our rights, including investigating and preventing fraud, spam, or other unauthorized activity, and complying with legal obligations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If we use your information for any other purpose not listed here, we will notify you and obtain your consent as required by applicable law.</p>

            <h2 id="duration-of-use">VI. HOW LONG WE KEEP AND USE YOUR DATA</h2>

            <p>We will keep your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide the functional service of the App and to fulfill our legal obligations. If you decide that you no longer want us to use your information that we physically access and store, you can request that we delete your personal information and close your account.</p>
            <p>However, some data may still be stored for a limited period of time (but no longer than necessary) if required by law (such as for taxation, accounting, or auditing purposes) or to maintain the safety and backup of data, prevent fraud, or other malicious acts.</p>

            <h2 id="fourth-sharing">V. SHARING OF DATA</h2>

            <p>When we integrate external services, we carefully select third-party providers who ensure the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data. However, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to such third-party providers. We are not liable for any accidental loss or unauthorized access to your personal data due to the actions of third-party providers.</p>
            <p>We do not rent or sell your personal data to third parties, but we may share information from tools like cookies, log files, device identifiers, and location data with third-party organizations that provide automatic data processing technologies for the App. We do not have control over these third parties' tracking technologies or their usage.</p>
            <p>We may also share certain information, such as cookie data, with third-party advertising partners. This information enables third-party ad networks to deliver targeted ads that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
            <p>In order to provide us with the necessary infrastructure for the delivery and improvement of our services, we may engage the following third-party service providers:</p>
